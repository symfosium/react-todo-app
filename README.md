# React Todo App

I'm thrilled to share with you my very first app developed using React and Vite, and it's now live on GitHub! This project has been an exciting journey of learning and exploration for me, and I can't wait to showcase what I've built:)

## Project Overview:

The todo-app is a simple yet efficient task management application developed using React and Vite. It allows users to create, edit, marks as done and delete tasks, helping them stay organized and productive.

## Technologies Used:
**React:** The app is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture simplifies the development process and enhances code reusability.

**Vite:** Vite is used as the build tool for the project. It offers fast and efficient development experience with features like hot module replacement (HMR) and lightning-fast builds.

**FontAwesome Icons:** FontAwesome provides a wide range of scalable vector icons that enhance the visual appeal of the application. Icons are used for various UI elements, improving user experience.

**React Icons:** React Icons is another library used for adding icons to the application. It provides a collection of popular icon packs that can be easily integrated into React applications.

**uuid:** The uuid package is utilized for generating unique identifiers for tasks. It ensures that each task has a distinct identifier, preventing any conflicts or duplications.
